            <p>From Eithan, <br></p>
            <p>Helo its me, Happy 3rd Anniversary us! Time flies by so fast, so I made the gallery to remember things we did this past year, I know it isn't everything as doing this was a lot harder than expected ðŸ˜†<br></p>
            <p>I know that things have been hard for both of us the past year, we've been through a lot and still we stuck together through thick and thin. I know this isn't the most grandest thing someone can do as an Anniversary gift but I still tried my best with this one.</p>
            <p>There are still so many things that I want to experience together with you (mostly the problem is because we're broke) but I hope in the future we can do them someday <br></p>
            <p>Open the next letters to read them ðŸ˜‰</p>

            <p>From your little monkeh, <br></p>
            <p>There are so many places I wanna visit with you, one of them is still this, and I hope that you won't give up on wanting to see them</p>

            <p>There are also some countries that I wanna visit with you too like these for example (you can guess which they are)</p>

            <p>Now these aren't everything and I'm sure there's many more places out there but these are the things I thought of (especially japan) <br></p>
            <p>I also know you want a home that looks comfy but good at the same time, we can also have different rooms so we can decorate them, and have sleep overs and stuff <br></p>

            <p>From your stinki, <br></p>
            <p>I haven't been perfect, or great at all, but you make me want to become a better person, and I know you want to be better too. <br></p>
            <p>Changing is very hard, but not impossible, I still believe that people can change for the good. I know that we have the power to be able to change and achieve the things we want to achieve. <br></p>
            <p>I'm really lucky to have you, and I feel really bad for hurting you a lot in the past. But still you stuck with me throughout all of it, even though you were deeply in pain. I will support you through everything, and I know that you always have my back <br></p>    
            <p>Happy 3rd Anniversary! I love you very much <br>
            Love, Eithan</p>
